{"name":"Data-management-and-visualisation","tagline":"Assignment 1","body":"### Step 1: Choose a dataset.\r\nI have chosen the Gapminder dataset because there are a lot of possibilities to gain new information and find less known connections\r\n### Step 2: Identify special interest.\r\nI would like to know more about life expectancy and employment rates. Is there any difference between the genders?  \r\n### Step 3: Prepare a codebook.\r\n* femaleemployrate:  (2007) female employees age 15+ (% of the population). Percentage of female population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.\r\n* employrate: (2007) total employees age 15+ (% of the population). Percentage of total population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.\r\n* lifeexpectancy 2011 life expectancy at birth (years). The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Identify a second topic association with the original topic.\r\nI would like to know more about the connection between employment rates and other issues (e.g. breast cancer, urban rate). Is there any difference between the genders in the case of urban rate? Is the number of breast cancer cases affected  by the female employment rates? \r\n\r\n### Step 5. Codebook extension.\r\n* breastcancerper100TH: (2002) breast cancer new cases per 100,000 female. A number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the certain year.\r\n* urbanrate (2008) urban population (% of total). Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by\r\nnational statistical offices (calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects).\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Literature review\r\n\r\n### Step 7: Hypotesis\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
