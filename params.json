{"name":"Data-management-and-visualisation","tagline":"Assignment 1&2","body":"##Assignment 1\r\n### Step 1: Choose a dataset.\r\nI have chosen the Gapminder dataset because there are a lot of possibilities to gain new information and find less known connections\r\n### Step 2: Identify special interest.\r\nI would like to know more about life expectancy and employment rates. Is there any difference between the genders?  \r\n### Step 3: Prepare a codebook.\r\n* femaleemployrate:  (2007) female employees age 15+ (% of the population). Percentage of female population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.\r\n* employrate: (2007) total employees age 15+ (% of the population). Percentage of total population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.\r\n* lifeexpectancy 2011 life expectancy at birth (years). The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Identify a second topic association with the original topic.\r\nI would like to know more about the connection between employment rates and other issues (e.g. breast cancer, urban rate). Is there any difference between the genders in the case of urban rate? Is the number of breast cancer cases affected  by the female employment rates? \r\n\r\n### Step 5. Codebook extension.\r\n* urbanrate (2008) urban population (% of total). Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by\r\nnational statistical offices (calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects).\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Literature review\r\nThere is a lot of review about the connection of the life expectancy and employment rate. It is believed that the employed people live longer than unemployed (reasons are really varied mainly socioeconomic ones)and the effect in case of male gender is more intense  [Oyen et al., European Journal of Ageing (2010), Volume 7, Issue 4, pp 229-237; Feather, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology (1992), Volume 65, Issue 4, pages 315â€“330]. \r\nUrbanisation also affects the life expectancy and the employment rates, but there is really little information about the gender effect in this topic. \r\n\r\n### Step 7: Hypotesis\r\nMy hypotheses are life expectancy depends on employment rate, but gender could change the intensity of the dependence, and state of the urbanisation has a really big effect. \r\n\r\n## Assignment 2\r\n\r\n###Code\r\n` import pandas\r\nimport numpy\r\n\r\npandas.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format\r\ndata = pandas.read_csv('gapminder.csv', low_memory = False)\r\ndata_columns = map(str.lower, data.columns)\r\n\r\n####setting variables you will be working with to numeric\r\n\r\ndata['femaleemployrate'] = data['femaleemployrate'].convert_objects(convert_numeric=True)\r\ndata['employrate'] = data['employrate'].convert_objects(convert_numeric=True)\r\ndata['lifeexpectancy'] = data['lifeexpectancy'].convert_objects(convert_numeric=True)\r\n\r\n####frequency counts\r\ndata['lifeexpectancy_range'] = pandas.cut(data.lifeexpectancy, range(0,110, 10))\r\nle = data['lifeexpectancy_range'].value_counts(sort = False, normalize = True)\r\n\r\ndata['femaleemployrate_range'] = pandas.cut(data.femaleemployrate, range(0,110, 10))\r\nfe = data['femaleemployrate_range'].value_counts(sort= False, normalize= True)\r\n\r\ndata['employrate_range']= pandas.cut(data.employrate, range(0,110, 10))\r\nem = data['employrate_range'].value_counts(sort= False,normalize = True)\r\n\r\nprint 'female employrate:'\r\nprint fe*100\r\n\r\nprint 'employrate:'\r\nprint em*100\r\n\r\nprint 'life expectancy:'\r\nprint le*100 `\r\n\r\n### Frequency tables\r\nfemale employrate:\r\n(0, 10]      0.00\r\n(10, 20]     3.29\r\n(20, 30]     5.16\r\n(30, 40]    15.96\r\n(40, 50]    23.47\r\n(50, 60]    21.60\r\n(60, 70]     8.92\r\n(70, 80]     3.76\r\n(80, 90]     1.41\r\n(90, 100]    0.00\r\ndtype: float64\r\n\r\nemployrate:\r\n(0, 10]      0.00\r\n(10, 20]     0.00\r\n(20, 30]     0.00\r\n(30, 40]     2.35\r\n(40, 50]    15.02\r\n(50, 60]    31.46\r\n(60, 70]    22.07\r\n(70, 80]     9.86\r\n(80, 90]     2.82\r\n(90, 100]    0.00\r\ndtype: float64\r\n\r\nlife expectancy:\r\n(0, 10]      0.00\r\n(10, 20]     0.00\r\n(20, 30]     0.00\r\n(30, 40]     0.00\r\n(40, 50]     4.23\r\n(50, 60]    13.62\r\n(60, 70]    17.84\r\n(70, 80]    43.19\r\n(80, 90]    10.80\r\n(90, 100]    0.00\r\ndtype: float64\r\n\r\n### Evaluation:\r\nFemale employment range is between 10 and 90%, the most common range is between 40-60% in the investigated dataset. Overall employment rate is between 30 and 90%, and the most common range is 50-60%. The difference of the minimum states that in some countries more male work than woman. The life expectancy in between 40-90 years, the most common range is between 70-80 years.\r\nDetailed examination of this dataset will continue.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
